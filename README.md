The main dataset includes all observations from the train and the test dataset. In addition two variables have been added; 'activity' identifying the activity performed during the measurement of all the other variables, and 'subject' representing the number identifying the volunteer who performed the activity.


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- 'run_analysis.R': R script that performs the analysis.

- 'CodeBook.md': List of all features.

- 'tidydata.txt': contains a summary (average) of all measued variables by 'subject' and 'activity'.
